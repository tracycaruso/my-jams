# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# rake db:seed
# Song.create(title: "Baby", artist: "Justin Bieber")
# Song.create(title: "Drunk in Love", artist: "Beyonce")
# Song.create(title: "Fancy", artist: "Iggy Azalea")
# Song.create(title: "Problem", artist: "Ariana Grande")
#
# puts "Creates #{Song.count} songs."
